    "text": "Background\nI started writing this note while working for Zurich Instruments, a Swiss maker of scientific instrumentation. At that time, the company was selling only one product, a lock-in amplifier, and we were naturally tackling all customers’ problems in terms of demodulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of pure amplitude modulated (left) and pure phase modulated (right) signals: in the first case the amplitude is time-dependent, in the second the spacing between successive zero crossings is time-dependent, while the amplitude remains constant.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short, a lock-in amplifier finds the amplitude \\(A\\) and phase \\(\\varphi\\) of an input signal of the type\n\\[\nV_S(t) = A\\cos(2\\pi f_Ct+\\varphi).\n\\tag{1}\\] by a process called demodulation. The existing literature explains it with the multiplication of the input signal by sine and cosine of the reference phase, also referred to as the in-phase and quadrature of the reference but I found this explanation lacked in clarity.\nThe multiplication by sine and cosine is equivalent to looking at the signal from a reference frame rotating with the reference phase. This element is key for the pictorial representation of amplitude and phase modulation."

    "text": "Complex Phasors to Represent Real Signals\nThe generic modulated signal of Equation 1 can also be written in the complex plane as the sum of two phasors, each one of length \\(\\tfrac{1}{2}A\\) rotating at the same speed \\(\\omega_C=2\\pi f_C\\), in opposite directions:\n\\[\n\\frac{A(t)}{2}\\left(e^{j[\\omega_Ct+\\varphi(t)]}+e^{ - j[\\omega_Ct+\\varphi(t)]} \\right)\n\\tag{2}\\] with a constant carrier angular frequency \\(\\omega_C\\) and (possibly) time-dependent \\(A(t)\\) and \\(\\varphi(t)\\).\nFrom a spectral point of view, the two phasors are the exact copy of each other, one at positive frequency \\(+f_C\\) and the other at negative frequency \\(-f_C\\), with amplitude \\(\\tfrac{1}{2}A\\) and phase \\(\\varphi\\). We therefore discard the negative frequency component \\(-f_C\\) term because it has the same spectral content as the one at positive frequency, just mirrored. We also neglect the constant factor \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) that is irrelevant for amplitude and phase modulation. We are left with\n\\[ A(t)e^{j[\\omega_C t + \\varphi(t)]}. \\] Next, we want to get rid of the carrier, which only shifts the spectrum by the constant quantity \\(\\omega_C\\) but carries otherwise no useful information. To do so, we multiply the quantity above by \\(e^{-j\\omega_C t}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The phasor of a generically modulated signal can sweep the grey area. In pure AM, only the length \\(A(t)\\) is time dependent, in pure phase modulation, only the phase changes. The amplitude and phase modulations are not restricted to be a fraction of the radius and \\(\\pi\\) respectively.\n\n\n\nThe multiplication by \\(e^{-j\\omega_C t}\\) can also be interpreted as a change of the reference frame: indeed complex numbers provide a convenient way of dealing with rotations on a 2D plan.\nSuppose to be standing at the origin and rotate anti-clockwise with angular velocity \\(\\omega_C\\). In this rotating frame2, the phasor will appear as essentially steady3 except for the amplitude and phase modulation given by\n\\[\nd(t) = A(t)e^{j\\varphi(t)}\n\\tag{3}\\] In general this signal is neither a pure amplitude nor a frequency modulated signal since both vary as shown by the black arrow in Figure 2.\nIn an amplitude modulated signal, only the phasor length \\(A(t)\\) changes (the blue line in the figure) but not its phase: in other words, all the changes are along the phasor direction and not perpendicular to it. Phase modulation on the other hand would instead move the phasor on a circle (red line), with no changes to its radius."

    "text": "Amplitude Modulation\nWe will see that the sidebands of amplitude and narrow band phase modulations differ only by an angle: that is why they are indistinguishable by Fourier power spectral analysis because the phase information is lost when squaring the Fourier transform. It is easy to understand the origin of the phase difference using complex phasors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The decomposition of the sidebands of an AM signal: the sidebands must add up to have only a contribution collinear to the carrier phasor. Modulation of type \\(\\cos(\\omega_mt)\\) a) in the time domain and b) in the frequency domain and similarly for \\(\\sin(\\omega_m t)\\). In the drawing we have assumed the carrier phase offset to be zero such that the carrier phasor is pointing in the \\(x\\)–direction and having only real contribution. The curved arrows in a) and c) show the direction of rotation of the modulation phasors.\n\n\n\nA general AM signal has a modulated amplitude \\(A(t)\\) and a constant phase offset \\(\\varphi(t)=\\varphi_0\\). To be more specific, I take a pure tone AM signal\n\\[\nd_\\textrm{AM}(t) \\equiv 1+h\\cos(\\omega_mt) = 1+\\frac{h}{2}\\left[e^{+j\\omega_mt}+e^{-j\\omega_mt}\\right]\n\\tag{4}\\] with carrier amplitude \\(1\\), amplitude modulation \\(h\\) and angular frequency \\(\\omega_m\\) (typically \\(\\omega_m\\ll \\omega_C\\) although this is not relevant for the discussion). For the moment I also set \\(\\varphi_0\\) equal to zero.\nWe need to consider both modulation phasors of Equation 4. With reference to Figure 3 a), the modulation of the amplitude, \\(h\\cos(\\omega_mt)\\), originates from the two phasors of length \\(\\frac{h}{2}\\) rotating in opposite directions, each with frequency \\(f_m\\); their sum, the thick blue arrow, lays always along the \\(x\\)–axis. These are the two sidebands of the AM spectrum.\n\nPhase of AM Sidebands\nWhat about their relative phase in the Fourier (frequency) space? The pictorial representation provides the answer. The phase is determined by the phasors’ value at \\(t=0\\): phasor pointing along the \\(x\\)–axis have real amplitude, phasors pointing along \\(y\\) imaginary amplitude.\nIn the AM case, the signal is only modulated in the direction collinear to the carrier phasor and the two sidebands must always be at relative angles such that the phasors’ sum satisfy this constraint.\nFor instance, for the modulation of Equation 4, both phasors have real value \\(+\\tfrac{h}{2}\\) at \\(t=0\\) or \\(0^\\circ\\) with respect to the carrier. Figure 3 b) show the carrier, purely real because we have chosen \\(\\varphi_0=0\\) and the two sidebands pointing in the same direction as that of the carrier. This is the “textbook” picture for AM.\nThis picture changes had we instead chosen an amplitude modulation of the form\n\\[ 1+h\\sin(\\omega_mt) = 1 - \\frac{jh}{2}\\left[e^{+j\\omega_mt}-e^{-j\\omega_mt}\\right] \\] as in Figure 3 c). Here the phasor with negative frequency has value \\(+\\tfrac{jh}{2}\\) at \\(t=0\\) or \\(+90^\\circ\\) with respect to the carrier; the other at positive frequency has value \\(-\\tfrac{jh}{2}\\) or \\(-90^\\circ\\) to the carrier. Figure 3 d). The \\(90^°\\) angle comes from the trigonometric identity \\(\\sin(\\omega_mt) = \\cos(\\omega_mt - \\tfrac{\\pi}{2})\\)\nWe are left to quickly discuss the case \\(\\varphi_0\\ne 0\\). Now the carrier phasor has an angle \\(\\varphi_0\\) with the \\(x\\)-axis; since the signal amplitude is always modulated collinear to the carrier phasor, both modulation phasors acquire the phase \\(\\varphi_0\\)."

We refer again to Equation 3: a general PM signal has a modulated phase \\(\\varphi(t)\\) and a constant amplitude \\(A(t)\\) assumed here for simplicity to be \\(A(t)=1\\).\nConsider now a pure tone PM signal\n\\[\nd_\\textrm{PM}(t) \\equiv e^{jh\\sin(\\omega_mt)}\n\\tag{5}\\] with modulation index \\(h\\). Is there an intuitive way of showing why the PM signal of Equation 5 has a frequency spectrum consisting of an infinite number of sidebands at \\(\\pm n\\omega_m\\) and the amplitude of the \\(n\\)-th sideband is given by the \\(n\\)-th Bessel function?\n\nPictorial Representation of First Set of Sidebands\n\\(d_\\textrm{PM}(t)\\) has constant amplitude, so it describes a phasor that moves on a circle of radius \\(1\\).

This term must contribute twice per cycle of the modulation phasor and must therefore have a \\(\\cos(2\\omega_mt)\\) dependence. d) \\(\\bar{b}_2(t) = b_2\\cos(2\\omega_mt)\\) gives a positive contribution at \\(t=0\\): in order for their sum to be 1, \\(b_0\\) must decrease.\n\n\n\nTo find the approximated values of \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\), we impose that \\(e^{jh\\sin(\\omega_mt)}\\) and its approximation\n\\[ b_0 + jb_1\\sin(\\omega_mt) \\] are equal at some values of \\(\\omega_mt\\), for instance that the real parts are equal at \\(\\omega_mt = 0\\) and the imaginary parts at \\(\\omega_mt = \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}\\). This choice gives\n\\[ b_0(h) = 1,\\quad b_1(h) = \\sin h \\approx h. \\] A different choice of points would have given a slightly different approximation4.\nThis small \\(h\\) regime, typically \\(h&lt;0.2\\), is called narrow band PM because it can be fully described by a carrier and the two sidebands \\(b_1\\) at \\(\\pm \\omega_m\\), thereby occupying a very limited portion of the frequency spectrum.\n\n\nPhase of PM Sidebands\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: a) The decomposition of the sidebands of a small modulation index PM signal: the sidebands must add up to have only a contribution perpendicular to the carrier phasor. b) Fourier transform of a PM signal with time dependent modulation \\(\\sin(\\omega_mt)\\) and c) \\(\\cos(\\omega_mt)\\). d) Fourier spectrum including the \\(2f_m\\) sidebands (red) generated by the term \\(\\bar{b}_2(t)\\).\n\n\n\nThe small \\(h\\) approximation of the phase modulation\n\\[\n1 + j h \\sin(\\omega_mt) = 1 + \\frac{h}{2}\\left[e^{+j\\omega_mt} - e^{-j\\omega_mt}\\right]\n\\tag{6}\\] looks very similar to the amplitude modulation Equation 4, two sidebands at \\(\\pm f_m\\). In the PM case, however, the signal is modulated in the direction orthogonal to the carrier as Figure 5 a) shows and the two sidebands must be at an angle such that their sum is \\(180^\\circ\\) with the carrier.\nFor the modulation of Equation 6, the sideband at positive frequency \\(+f_m\\) has amplitude \\(+\\frac{h}{2}\\) at \\(t=0\\) and the sideband at negative frequency \\(-\\frac{h}{2}\\), as shown in Figure 5 b).\nHad we instead chosen a phase modulation of the form\n\\[ e^{jh\\cos(\\omega_mt)} \\approx 1 + jh\\cos(\\omega_mt) = 1 + \\frac{jh}{2}\\left[e^{+j\\omega_mt} - e^{-j\\omega_mt}\\right] \\] with the two modulation phasors at \\(t=0\\) having the purely imaginary amplitude \\(\\frac{jh}{2}\\), the Fourier transform would have looked like Figure 5 c)."
